# DIP
SnapFX is a mini project built with Flask and OpenCV, designed to let users apply artistic and funny filters to their images or webcam feed. Whether you want to look like a cartoon, turn into a sketch, or just have fun with swirl and mirror effects â€“ SnapFX has it all!




SnapFX successfully demonstrates how Digital Image Processing can be applied in a fun, engaging, and educational way. By combining simple yet effective image processing algorithms with a user-friendly interface, the project achieves its goal of making image filtering accessible and insightful. The application not only entertains but also provides a platform for learning DIP concepts, making it useful for academic institutions, hobbyists, and professionals alike. Its ease of use and real-time output capabilities ensure that users can instantly visualize the impact of different filters, thereby deepening their understanding of image transformation techniques.
